# WISE_LCs
A repo where I'll keep my notes, codes and write-up for the unWISE QSO
Light Curve project(s).

## Layout of repo
Should be fairly self-explantory. If not, feel free to email me!! ;-)


## Acknowledgement 
This project is very much still in progress and ``in prep.''  If you
are interested in this work, and/or need to cite it, please cite Ross
et al., 2017, ApJS, in prep.  and give the GitHub repo and latest
commit number.
