Yeah, I think it comes directly from the Tractor catalogs, so that the
*Q.fits files include all columns from the Tractor catalogs for the
relevant set of sources. I believe the sweep files lack the WISE light
curve columns, so I don't think those could have been used to create
the *Q.fits files.

Yes, okay, sure. But, what’s the ‘original’ source here for the DECaLS information in the survey-dr3-DRxQ.fits files??
Looking on http://legacysurvey.org/dr3/files/ suggests these survey-dr3-DRxQ.fits files have “Tractored survey photometry”.
Thus I’m (now) presuming these are from the Tractor Catalog files, e.g. on http://legacysurvey.org/dr3/catalogs/ ??

(I just want to make exactly and precisely sure I know/understand where the original DECaLS data is coming from!!)

Thanks again,
