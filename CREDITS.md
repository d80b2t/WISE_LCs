Started this repo. Pushing on the idea of CLQs in the IR.  Main author

WISE and NEO-WISE guru. Ran through the full WISE(*) dataset and

this in the write-up. Wrote the IDL code that first took the SDSS DR7Q

General coordinate and pushing on the Quasar aspects in the WISE
data. Initially reached out to AMM and NPR to get things going along

Supplied current, 20160303, version of the figures.  These are *not*
the final versions, but ``good enough for government work''....

Obtained second and third epoch spectra for W1052+1519 and W1100-0052
(along with DS).
