# CREDITS

## Nic Ross (NPR): 
Started this repo. Pushing on the idea of CLQs in the IR.  Main author
of the manuscript.

## Aaron Meisner (AMM):
WISE and NEO-WISE guru. Ran through the full WISE(*) dataset and
selected out the objects that have the large flux changes. Details of
this in the write-up. Wrote the IDL code that first took the SDSS DR7Q
and BOSS DR12Q and matched them to NEOWISE(R).

## Daniel Stern (DS):
General coordinate and pushing on the Quasar aspects in the WISE
data. Initially reached out to AMM and NPR to get things going along
here.

## David Schlegel:
Supplied current, 20160303, version of the figures.  These are *not*
the final versions, but ``good enough for government work''....

## Andrew Drake (AD): 
Obtained second and third epoch spectra for W1052+1519 and W1100-0052
(along with DS).

## Matthew Graham (MG):
Provided the CRTS light-curves.

## Arjun Dey (AD):
Early communictations, and group coordinations and guidance.

## Hyunsung Jun (HJ), Saavik K Ford (SKF) Barry L McKernan (BLM):
Theoretical interpretations and discussion on a short email
correspondence.

## Demitri Muna‏
