A new physical interpretation of optical and infrared variability in quasars

Variability in the quasar J1100-0053

Changing-look quasars are a recently identified class of active
galaxies in which the strong UV continuum and/or broad optical
hydrogen emission lines associated with unobscured quasars either
appear or disappear on timescales of months to years.  The physical
processes responsible for this behaviour are still debated, but
changes in the black hole accretion rate or accretion disk structure
appear more likely than changes in obscuration. Here we report on four
epochs of spectroscopy of SDSS J110057.70-005304.5, a quasar at a
redshift of $z=0.378$ whose UV continuum and broad hydrogen emission
lines have faded, and then returned over the past $\approx$20
years. The change in this quasar was initially identified in the
infrared, and an archival spectrum from 2010 shows an intermediate
phase of the transition during which the flux below rest-frame
$\approx$3400\AA\ has decreased by close to an order of
magnitude. This combination is unique compared to previously published
examples of changing-look quasars, and is best explained by dramatic
changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk. The optical
continuum has been rising since mid-2016, leading to a prediction of a
rise in hydrogen emission line flux in the next year. Increases in the
infrared flux are beginning to follow, delayed by a $\sim$3 year
observed timescale. If our model is confirmed, the physics of
changing-look quasars are governed by processes at the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole, and the structure
of the innermost disk. The easily identifiable and monitored
changing-look quasars would then provide a new probe and laboratory of
the nuclear central engine.
