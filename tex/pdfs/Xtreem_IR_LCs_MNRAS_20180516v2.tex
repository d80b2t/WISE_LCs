\begin{abstract}
Changing-look quasars are a recently identified class of active galaxies in which the strong UV continuum and/or broad optical hydrogen emission lines associated with unobscured quasars either appear or disappear on timescales of months to years.  The physical processes responsible for this behaviour are still debated, but changes in the black hole accretion rate or accretion disk structure appear more likely than changes in obscuration. Here we report on four epochs of spectroscopy of SDSS J110057.70-005304.5, a quasar at a redshift of $z=0.378$ whose UV continuum and broad hydrogen emission lines have faded, and then returned over the past $\approx$20 years. The change in this quasar was initially identified in the infrared, and an archival spectrum from 2010 shows an intermediate phase of the transition during which the flux below rest-frame $\approx$3400\AA\ has decreased by close to an order of magnitude. This combination is unique compared to previously published examples of changing-look quasars, and is best explained by dramatic changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk. The optical continuum has been rising since mid-2016, leading to a prediction of a rise in hydrogen emission line flux in the next year. Increases in the infrared flux are beginning to follow, occurring on a $\sim$3 year observed timescale. If our model is confirmed, the physics of changing-look quasars are governed by processes at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole, and the structure of the innermost disk. The easily identifiable and monitored changing-look quasars would then provide a new probe and laboratory of the nuclear central engine.

\section{Introduction}
The Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha-$disk model \citep{SS73} has long been
used to describe the basic properties of the optically thick,
geometrically thin accretion disks expected to orbit the supermassive
black holes at the nuclei of quasars. This accretion disk is thought
to be the origin of thermal continuum emission observed in the
rest-frame ultraviolet and optical. The thermal emission seen in the
infrared spectrum of quasars is believed to originate from molecular
dust outside the accretion disk and traditional broadline region
(BLR). Thus, the IR flux is directly proportional to the emission from
the disk, reprocessed by the dusty reservoir and delayed by the
light-travel time between the two \citep[see e.g.,][for
reviews]{Antonucci1993, Perlman2008, Lasota2016}. As such, the thermal
accretion disk photons are the seeds for both the X-ray emission --
due to Compton-upscattering in the corona
\citep[e.g.,][]{Begelman1983, Risaliti2009, Lusso2017} and the thermal
mid-IR emission from the torus.

The $\alpha$-disk model assumes that the disk is geometrically thin
(i.e., $h/r \ll 1$ where $h/r$ is the disk aspect ratio) and that
angular momentum is transported by a kinematic viscosity, $\nu$,
parametrized by \citet{SS73} as $\nu = \alpha c_{\rm s} h$ where
$c_{\rm s}$ is the local mean sound speed in the disk and $h$ is the
scale-height perpendicular to the disk plane. The thermal emission
need not be, but often is, treated as a superposition of blackbodies
at varying annuli with an effective temperature
dependence\footnote{This r$^{-3/4}$ temperature dependence is not
specific to the $\alpha$-parametrization, and is independent from the
nature of the viscosity, provided that the disk is geometrically thin,
steady and heat dissipation and angular momentum transport and caused
by the same, local mechanism.} going as $T(r) \propto r^{-3/4}$.

Given the size scales and temperatures associated with supermassive
black holes, a substantial fraction of the bolometric luminosity
should be in the form of UV photons -- the so-called ``Big Blue Bump''
\citep{Shields1978, Malkan_Sargent1982}. For the optically thick, UV
emitting disk to accrete onto the black hole, substantial angular
momentum must be lost.  The kinematic viscosity of the plasma,
$\alpha$, seems the likely mechanism that transports angular momentum
outward.  This viscosity is likely due to magnetorotational
instability \citep[MRI; ][]{Balbus_Hawley1991} with additional
contributions to turbulence from the effects of objects embedded in
the disk \citep[e.g.,][]{McKernan2014}.

However, as has long been established \citep[e.g., ][]{Alloin1985} and
recently re-visited \citep[e.g., ][]{LaMassa2015, Runnoe2016,
MacLeod2016, Ruan2016, Rumbaugh2017, Yang2017, Lawrence2018}, the
observation of even slowly varying Balmer emission lines in quasars
strongly suggests that if a thermal accretion disk does indeed
contribute substantially to the ionizing or optical continuum, then it
cannot be in quasi-steady state equilibrium. The variations must be
due to more chaotic disturbances or instabilities in the disk that
propagate at considerably higher speeds than the radial accretion flow
and possibly as fast as the orbital velocity.

Furthermore as e.g., \citet{Koratkar_Blaes1999} and
\citet{Sirko_Goodman2003} among others point out, the observed
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of typical quasars differ
markedly from classical $\alpha$-disk theoretical predictions
\citep[][]{SS73, Pringle1981} with a typical observed quasar SED flat
in $\lambda F_{\lambda}$ over several decades in wavelength
\citep{Elvis1994, Richards2006b}. Also, real AGN disks seem to be
cooler \citep[e.g., ][]{Lawrence2012} and larger
\citep[e.g.,][]{Pooley2007, Morgan2010, Morgan2012, Mosquera2011} than
the $\alpha$-disk model predicts. The $\alpha$-disk is an ad hoc
parameterization of disk viscosity and does not permit predictions of
global changes from local perturbations \citep{King2012}.

Nevertheless, in this paper, we utilize the mathematically simple
$\alpha$-disk model as a framework and departure point for our own
disk models. Here, we build on previous work \citep{Sirko_Goodman2003,
Zimmerman2005, Hameury2009} and introduce a phenomenological model
which does allow changes across the accretion disk and, crucially,
makes predictions which can be observed in the SED.

Changing-look quasars (CLQs) are luminous active galaxies in which the
strong UV continuum and/or broad optical hydrogen emission lines
associated with unobscured quasars either appear or disappear on
timescales of months to years. CLQs have traditionally been discovered
by looking for large, $| \Delta m | >1$ magnitude changes in the
optical light curves of quasars or galaxies. In contrast, we have
taken advantage of the ongoing mid-IR Near-Earth Object Wide-Field
Infrared Survey Explorer Reactivation mission \citep[NEOWISE-R;
][]{Mainzer2014, Meisner2017a, Meisner2017b}, supplemented with the
optical Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS\footnote{{\tt
legacysurvey.org/decamls/}}), in order to discover new changing-look
quasars.  While previous efforts have used the 1-year baseline of the
WISE mission to identify changing-look quasars
\citep[e.g.,][]{Assef2018, Stern2018}, our investigation is the first
to extend this selection to the infrared using NEOWISE-R mission
data. We have identified a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
quasars that show significant changes in their IR flux over the course
of a few years. Importantly, our IR light curves enable us to set
limits on SED changes due to obscuration.

In this article we present the $z=0.378$ quasar SDSS
J110057.70-005304.5 (hereafter J1100-0053).  J1100-0053 was a known
quasar we identified as interesting due to its IR light curve. We have
spectral observations for J1100-0053 showing a transition in the
blue-continuum into a `dim state' where the rest-frame UV flux is
suppressed, and then returning to a blue-continuum sloped quasar.  The
model we present invokes changes at the Innermost stable circular
orbit (ISCO, defined as $r_{\textsc{ISCO}}={\frac {6\,GM}{c^{2}}}$ in
the Schwarzschild metric), to be the triggering event for substantial
changes in the wider accretion disk, including major structural
changes out to 150$r_{g}$ (where $r_{\rm g}$ is the gravitational
radius; $r_{\rm g}=\frac{GM}{c^2}$). Such a model explains changes in
the broad emission lines, as well as the optical and IR light curves.

This paper is organised as follows.  In Section 2, we describe
our sample selection, catalogs and observationa data sets.  In Section
3, we present various theoretical models and discuss if and how each
describes and explains the data.  We conclude in Section 4.  We
report all magnitudes on the AB zero-point system \citep{Oke_Gunn1983,
Fukugita1996}.  For the WISE bands, $m_{\rm AB} = m_{\rm Vega} + m$
where $m = (2.699, 3.339)$ for WISE W1 at 3.4$\mu$m and WISE W2 at
4.6$\mu$m, respectively \citep{Cutri2011}. We choose the
cosmological parameters $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.7$, $\Omega_{\rm M} =
0.3$, and $h = 0.7$ in order to be consistent with \citet{Shen2011}.

\section{Target Selection and Observations}  

\subsection{Selection in SDSS and NEOWISE-R of J1100-0053}
We started by matching the SDSS Data Release 7 \cite[DR7Q;
][]{Schneider2007} and the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 Quasar catalogues \cite[DR12Q;
][]{Paris2017} to the NEOWISE-R IR data. We use data from the
beginning of the WISE mission \citep[2010 January; ][]{Wright2010}
through the thrid-year of NEOWISE-R operations \citep[2016 December;
][]{Mainzer2011}. The WISE scan pattern leads to coverage of the
full-sky approximately once every six months (a ``sky pass''), but the
satellite was placed in hibernation in 2011 February and then
reactivated in 2013 October. Hence, our light curves have a cadence of
6 months with a 32 month sampling gap.

The W1/W2 light curves for $\sim$200,000 SDSS and BOSS spectroscopic
quasars were obtained by performing forced photometry at the locations
of DECam-detected optical sources \citep{Lang2014, Meisner2017a,
Meisner2017b}. This forced photometry was performed on time-resolved
coadds \citep{Lang2014}, each of which represents a stack of $\sim$12
exposures. The coaddition removes the possibility of probing
variability on $\lesssim$1 day time scales, but pushes $\approx$1.4
magnitudes deeper than individual exposures while removing virtually
all single-exposure artifacts (e.g. cosmic rays and satellites).

Approximately $\sim$30,000 of the SDSS/BOSS quasars with W1/W2
light-curves available are `IR-bright', in that they are above both
the W1 and W2 single exposure thresholds and therefore detected at
very high significance in the coadds. For this ensemble of objects,
the typical variation in each quasar's measured (W1-W2) color is 0.06
magnitudes.  This includes statistical and systematic errors which are
expected to contribute variations at the few hundredths of a magnitude
level. The typical measured single-band scatter is 0.07 magnitudes in
each of W1 and W2.

We undertook a search for outliers relative to these
trends. Specifically, we selected objects with the following
characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Monotonic variation in both W1 and W2 flux.
  \item W1 flux and W2 flux Pearson correlation coefficient $r \geq0.9$.
  \item $>$0.5 mag peak-to-peak variation in either W1 or W2.
\end{itemize}
This yields a sample of 248 sources. 31 of these are assumed to be
blazars due to the presence of Faint Images of the Radio Sky at
Twenty-Centimeters \citep[FIRST; ][]{Becker1995} radio counterparts,
and we discount them for further analyses. Another 22 objects are
outside the FIRST footprint, leaving 195 quasars in our IR-variable
sample, with no potential FIRST counterparts detected within 30''. 

Although aperture photometry and DECaLS forced photometry
\citep{Lang2014, Meisner2017a, Meisner2017b} are available, J1100-0053
is significantly above the single-exposure detection limit so it is
valid to obtain photometry from the publicly released W1/W2 Level 1b
(L1b) single-exposure images at the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive
(\href{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/}{IRSA}).  Upon querying the
combined the WISE All-Sky, WISE Post-Cryo and NEOWISE-R databases, we
have 101 measurements in 8 sky passes spanning nearly 2400 days.

\subsection{Optical Imaging}
Figure~\ref{fig:J110057_LC_CRTS} presents the light curve of SDSS
J110057.70-005304.5.  J1100-0053 was first detected in the National
Geographic Society-Palomar Observatory Sky Survey \cite[NGS-POSS;
][]{Abell1959, Minkowski_Abell1963book} in 1955 April. It is
catalogued in the SuperCOSMOS Science Archive
\citep[\href{http://ssa.roe.ac.uk/}{SSA}; ][]{Hambly2001_I,
Hambly2001_II} and due to its equatorial position was also observed by
the UK Schmidt Telescope \cite[UKST; ][]{Cannon1975,
Cannon1979book}. Querying the SSA returns {\it gCorMag} and {\it
sCorMag} which are the magnitudes assuming the object is either a
galaxy or star, respectively. We use the {\it sCorMag} values as is
appropriate for an image with flux dominated by the point-like AGN;
the {\it sCorMag} magnitudes are calibrated in the Vega system. For
J1100-0053 we find the magnitudes are: 18.10 mag in the blue UK-J
filter from MJD 45440.47 (1983 April 16); 17.49 mag in the red POSS-I
'E'-filter from MJD 35214.22 (1955 April 17); 17.92 mag in the red
UK-R filter from MJD 46521.47 (1986 April 01) and 17.71 mag in the
UK-I filter from MJD 47273.49 (1988 April 22). J1100-0053 is not in
the Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard
(DASCH\footnote{http://dasch.rc.fas.harvard.edu/project.php}).

J1100-0053 was imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the
$u$, $g$, $r$, $i$ and $z$-bands in 1999 March, and more recently by
the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) where there are 4, 13
and 4 exposures in the $g$, $r$ and $z$-bands, respectively, in the
DECaLS Data Release 3 \citep[DR3; ][]{Dey2018}. The $g$-band
observations span $\approx$3 years ($56727 \leq g_{\rm MJD} \leq
57816$), while the $r$- and $z$-band observations span $\approx$4
years ($56367 \leq r_{\rm MJD} \leq 57814$ and $56383 \leq z_{\rm MJD}
\leq 57815$).

Along with WISE IR data, optical data from the SDSS, Catalina
Real-time Transient Survey \citep[CRTS;][]{Drake2009, Mahabal2011},
the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research \citep[LINEAR; ][]{Sesar2011}
program and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System
\citep[PanSTARRS;][]{Kaiser2010, Stubbs2010, Tonry2012, Magnier2013}
are also available, and presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:J110057_LC_CRTS}.

    equivalent to a simple $\alpha$-disk model,][]{SS73}.  Torque at the

    plunging region, heats the inner disk, causing it to puff up and
    become more UV luminous.  The dotted red line shows a modified
    zero-torque model where the thermal disk emission interior to $80
    r_{\rm g}$ is suppressed by a factor of 10.}

\subsection{Additional Multiwavelength Data for J1100-0053}
J1100-0053 was observed by R\"{o}ntgensatellit (ROSAT) and appears in
the All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalogue \citep[RASS-BSC;
][]{Appenzeller1998, Voges1999} as 2RXS J110058.1-005259 with 27.00
counts (count error 6.14) and a count rate = 0.06$\pm$0.01
counts~s$^{-1}$ \citep{Boller2016}. The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic
Database (NED\footnote{https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/}) gives
J1100-0053 as having a flux $1.27\pm0.28 \times^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1-2.4 keV range (unabsorbed). J1100-0053 is not in
either the {\it Chandra} or XMM-{\it Newton} archives but is detected
by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer \citep[GALEX; ][]{Martin2005,
Morrissey2007} and has reported flux densities $19.29\pm0.12$ mag in
the far-UV and $18.89\pm0.05$ mag in the near-UV. As noted above,
there is no radio counterpart within 30 arcsec in the FIRST survey,
i.e. at 21cm. None of the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, {\it Spitzer
Space Telescope} or {\it Kepler} missions have observed J1100-0053.
It is also not in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)
\href{https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/}{Data Release 1}
\citep{Aihara2017} footprint.


\subsection{Spectroscopy}
\subsubsection{SDSS and BOSS Spectroscopy}

Figure~\ref{fig:J110057_spectra} shows the four optical spectra of
J1100-0053. J1100-0053 satisfied a number of spectroscopic targeting
flags making it a quasar target in SDSS \citep{Richards2002}. An SDSS
spectrum was obtained on MJD 51908 (SDSS Plate 277, Fiber 212) and the
spectrum of a $z=0.378$ quasar was catalogued in the SDSS Early Data
Release \citep{Stoughton2002, Schneider2002}. 
SDSS performs fiber-fed spectroscopy 

The second epoch spectrum is from the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey \citep[BOSS; ][]{Dawson2013} on MJD 55302 and
shows the downturn at $\lesssim$4300\AA\ (observed). SDSS-III BOSS
actively vetoed previously known $z<2$ quasars \citep{Ross2012}, but
due to J1100-0053 being selected as an ancillary target \citep[via a
white dwarf program;][]{Kepler2015, Kepler2016} a second spectral
epoch was obtained. Due to a design tradeoff to improve throughput in
the Ly$\alpha$-forest of quasar spectra in BOSS, quasar targets were
subject to spectrophotometric calibration errors
\citep{Margala2016}. These are introduced primarily due to offsets in
fiber-hole positioning between quasar targets and spectrophotometric
standard stars. However, since J1100-0053 was {\it not} a BOSS quasar
{\it target}, it is not subject to this ``blue offset''. 

J1100-0053 has no pipeline flag suggesting the spectrum was
compromised during data taking. We checked the calibration of BOSS
Plate 3836 that observed J1100-0053 and confirmed that the data were
high-SNR and that the behaviour in the blue spectrum was not due to
the instrument, telescope or data reduction.  One significant aspect
of the BOSS spectrum is the strong, broad Mg\,{\sc ii}\ emission line
atop a fading red continuum.  Mg\,{\sc ii}\ emission being prominent
in objects without otherwise strong continuum is very unusual, but not
unheard of.  For example, \citet{Roig2014} find a group of objects
with strong and broad Mg\,{\sc ii}\ line emission, but very weak
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission, and undetectably low near-ultraviolet
AGN continuum flux.


\subsubsection{Palomar Spectroscopy} 
A third epoch spectrum was obtained from the Palomar Hale 5m telescope
using the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) instrument.  Exposures of 600s
and 300s were taken in good conditions on UT 2017 February 25 (MJD
57809). Features to note include the continuum straddling Mg\,{\sc
ii}\ being blue in the 2017 spectrum, as it was for the SDSS spectrum
in 2000, as opposed to red, as it was for the BOSS spectrum in 2010. A
fourth spectral epoch was also taken using the Hale 5m and DBSP on
UT 2018 January 14 (MJD 58132). 

The first-epoch SDSS spectrum shows a typical blue quasar, but the
blue continuum decreases by nearly a factor of ten in flux in the
second epoch BOSS spectrum taken 10 years later. The blue continuum
then returns in the third epoch spectrum taken another 7 years later,
albeit at a diminished level relative to the initial spectrum.

The SDSS and BOSS spectroscopy is performed with 3'' and 2'' fibers,
respectively. The Palomar observations are done with 1.5 arcsec
slits. We note that the 2017 Palomar data was photometric, while 2018
Palomar data was not.  Both Palomar spectra were flux calibrated using
the sensitivity function calculated from the photometric night (in
2017), and then the spectra were scaled to have approximately matching
[O\,{\sc iii}] line strengths. As such, in the following, we note that
the larger [O\,{\sc iii}] luminosites obtained with the fiber spectra
as opposed to the slit spectra is consistent with [O\,{\sc iii}] being
obtained through wider apertures and the line being somewhat extended.


\subsubsection{Emission Line Fitting} 
We fit the SDSS spectrum for J1100-0053 with the models provided by
QSFit \citep[see][and
\href{http://qsfit.inaf.it/}{http://qsfit.inaf.it/} ]{Calderone2017},
we require three components in order to replicate the observed
asymmetric H$\beta$ emission line profile.  These comprise of a narrow
FWHM=1000 km s$^{-1}$ part, and two broad (11897$\pm$556 and
4594$\pm$341 km s$^{-1}$ parts.  QSFit considers these two broad
components as a single line, whose profile is given by the sum of the
two Gaussians, and the final FWHM of 7415$\pm$499 km s$^{-1}$ is
calculated on the latter profile.  Thus, we suggest that J1100-0053,
at least from its SDSS epoch, could be an ``anomalous H$\beta$
quasar'' as described by \citet{Steinhardt_Silverman2013}.

that the 5100 angstrom and H$\beta$ luminosities vary consistently.
We return to the H$\beta$ line profile in our modeling discussion in
Section 3.

While continuum changes in the rest-frame UV/optical spectra of
quasars are not a new discovery (see e.g., \citealt{Clavel1991}, the
review by \citealt{Ulrich1997} and more recent studies by
\citealt{VandenBerk2004, Pereyra2006, MacLeod2010} and
\citealt{Guo2016b}). However, the identification of a ``UV collapse''
for quasars has only recently been noted by \cite{Guo2016}.  Those
authors report the first discovery of a UV cutoff quasar, SDSS
J231742.60 +000535.1 (hereafter J2317+0005; redshift $z = 0.32$),
observed by SDSS three times, on UT 2000 September 29, UT 2001
September 25, and UT 2001 October 18. In the case of J2317+0005, a
cycle of UV emission collapse, quasar dimming, and recovery was
observed over the course of just a few weeks. For J1100-0053, the
cycle is far longer; however,the combination of optical and infrared
light curves, as well as observing J1100-0053 at four separate
spectral stages is currently unique. As such, J1100-0053 and
J2317+0005 are now two archetypal objects that any accretion disk
model must predict and explain \citep[e.g.,][]{Lawrence2018}.

In our sister study, \citet{Stern2018} report on a new
changing-look quasar, J1052+1519, identified with the same selection
as J1100-0053, and where the broad H$\beta$ emission has vanished
compared to an archival SDSS spectrum. The physical properties of
J1100-0053 derived from the MJD 51908 spectrum using the methods in
\citet{Shen2011}, are given in Table~\ref{tab:Shen_props}, where we
also give the properties of J2317+0005 \citep{Guo2016} and J1052+1519
\citep{Stern2018} for comparison.

\section{Phenomenological Modeling} 
In a similar vein to the discussion in \cite{Stern2018}, in this
section we discuss several models with the aim of determining the
physical mechamism(s) driving the light curve and spectral behaviour
of J1100-0053. The explanations come in two broad classes: obscuration
and changes in the accretion disk. Ultimately, we are forced towards
a model of the latter type that combines a cooling front propagating
in the accretion disk along with changes in the disk opacity.

\subsection{Scenario I: Obscuration by an Infalling Cloud}
We explore the possibility that an obscuring cloud, or clouds, cause
the observed light curve and spectral behaviour of J1100-0053. This
explanation is dismissed for the CLQ J0159+0033 in \citet{LaMassa2015}
but is the preferred explanation for J2317+0005 in \citet{Guo2016}.

In this scenario, the obscuring cloud(s) are required to cross the line
of sight. The clouds also need to block most of the inner disk such
that the ionizing radiation could not impact on the BLR or the torus
for a period of months to years, in order to explain both the IR drop and
broadline disappearance. An explanation of why the light curves
`recover' after a period of $\sim 2500$ days (observed-frame) is also
required; i.e., why do the light curves not rapidly return to their
original flux levels once the obscuring event is over.

Clouds should not typically infall; they need to lose angular momentum
if they are drawn from a distribution with Keplerian orbits, and even
if they do lose angular momentum, e.g., in a collision with clouds of 
approximately equal mass, they would likely be either destroyed or no
longer coherent. The relevant timescales here are the freefall and
cloud-crushing times. The freefall timescale is 
\begin{equation}
    t_{{\rm ff}}   \sim 100   \rm{yr}  \left(\frac{r}{0.4\rm{pc}}\right)^{3/2} 
                                            \left(\frac{M}{10^{8}M_{\odot}}\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities would destroy the clouds within the
cloud-crushing time, \citep[e.g., ][]{Nagakura2008, Hopkins2013,
Shiokawa2015, Bae2016}, given by
\begin{equation}
    t_{\rm cc} \sim 100\rm{yr} \left(\frac{\rho_{cloud}/\rho_{medium}}{10^{6}}\right)^{1/2} 
                                            \left(\frac{r_{\rm cloud}}{4 \times 10^{10}\rm{km}}\right) 
                                            \left(\frac{v_{\rm rel}}{10^{4}\rm{km/s}}\right)^{-1}.
\label{eqn:T_cloudcrushing}
\end{equation}
Thus, even if clouds did infall, they would end up fragmented, which
should pollute the inner disk.  The dust in the cloud would then be
well inside the dust sublimation radius 
\begin{equation}
    R_{\rm dust} \approx 0.4\rm{pc}\left(\frac{L}{10^{45}\rm{erg/s}}\right)^{1/2}
                                                   \left(\frac{T_{\rm sub}}{1500\rm{K}}\right)^{2.6}
\end{equation}
and so the dust will be destroyed in the $\sim$100 year free-fall from
the dust-sublimation region. Hence, one can not absorb the UV spectrum
with dust, since it will have been sublimated well before it arrives
at the inner disk.


\subsection{Scenario II: Accretion Disk Model}
Having discounted an obscuring event as the explanation for
J1100-0053, we turn to accretion disk models \citep[see also the
recent review by ][]{YuanNarayan2014}. We consider `cold' accretion
flows, described as optically thick, geometrically thin and which drive
relatively high mass accretion rates. They are `cold' in the sense
that the virial temperature of particles near the black hole is
low. Similarly, we characterize optically thin, geometrically thick
and low mass accretion rate flows as virially `hot' accretion flows.

After giving our model set-up, we discuss whether J1100-0053 can be
described by a `hot' accretion flow, such as the advection-dominated
accretion flow. We then discuss our preferred `cold' accretion flow
model, but where the temperature of the accretion disk is perturbed by
propagating cooling and heating fronts in the inner parts ($\leq 1000
r_{g}$) of the accretion disk. Our disk remains virially cold
throughout this cycle.
 
We start with a multi-temperature blackbody (MTB) model, with a $L
\propto T^4$ dependence and a $T \propto r^{-3/4}$ relation. A thin
accretion disk has a negligible radial pressure gradient. Therefore,
at each radius $R$ the gas orbits at the Keplerian angular frequency,
$\Omega_{\rm K} = (GM/r^{3})^{1/2}$, where $M$ is the mass of the
central object and possesses specific angular momentum $l= \sqrt{GMr}$. 

\citet{Zimmerman2005} compare models with `zero' and `non-zero' torque
at the ISCO, and the impact on the temperature profile of the
corresponding accretion disk, when the torque changes.  From
\citet{Zimmerman2005} the zero torque (ZT) luminosity is given by
\begin{equation}
L_{\rm disk}   =  \frac{G M \dot{M}}  {2 r_{\rm in}}    = 73.9 \sigma\left ( \frac{T_{\rm max}}{f}  \right )^{4}  r^{2}_{\rm in} 
\end{equation}
and the standard, non-zero torque (NZT) luminosity is given by:
\begin{equation}
L_{\rm disk} = \frac{3 G M \dot{M}}  {2 r_{\rm in}}    = 12.6 \sigma\left ( \frac{T_{\rm max}}{f}  \right )^{4}  r^{2}_{\rm in} 
\end{equation} 
where $f$ is a spectral hardening factor, with 
a canonical blackbody spectrum having $f=1$. 
In zero-torque models, temperature $T_{\rm ZT}$ goes to zero at the
inner edge of the disk (since the torque vanishes there) whereas a
non-zero torque temperature profile, $T_{\rm NZT}$ reaches its maximum
value at the inner edge of the disk (where the torque is maximal).
Given a MTB model for disk emission, these differences at small
$r_{\rm g}$ translate to large differences in the SED.

As in shown in Figure~\ref{fig:disk_suppression}, the SDSS spectrum
from 2000 is well fit with a thin \citet{SS73} $\alpha$-disk and the
NZT condition.  However, just switching to just the ZT condition,
while surpressing the bluer disk emissivity, is not sufficient to
explain the 2010 spectrum.

\subsubsection{Switching States to a RIAF/ADAFs:}
A possible explanation for the behaviour of J1100-0053 is that it
switches accretion modes, from a virially cold, high $\dot{M}$ flow to a
virially hot, lower $\dot{M}$ flow, with the latter being, i.e., a
radiatively inefficient accretion flow \citep[RIAF; ][]{Narayan1998,
Quataert2001} or an advection-dominated accretion flow \citep[ADAF;
][and references therein]{YuanNarayan2014}.

There are examples of this type of behaviour in lower-luminosity
objects.  For example, \citet{Nemmen2006} successfully explain the SED
for the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) of NGC
1097 with a model where the inner part of the flow is a virially hot
RIAF, and the outer part as a standard virially cold thin disk.

The broadband spectrum of NGC 1097 from \citet{Nemmen2006} initially
appears similar to the UV/optical 2010 spectrum of J1100-0053.  Figure
4 in \citet{Nemmen2006} shows the MTB-like model component from the
thin disk at $r>225r_{g}$ (their long dashed line) dramatically
decreasing at $\sim$10$^{15}$Hz ($\sim$300nm). \citet{Nemmen2006}
model the disk region interior to this as a RIAF\footnote{A change to
an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is also possible in this
model.} at a power (in $\nu L_{\nu}$), an order of magnitude lower
than the MTB in the optical, but spanning from the X-ray to the
far-IR.

\end{figure}
Can J1100-0053 switch states from a thin disk quasar to an ADAF at
small radii with the thin disk surviving at large radii?  Assuming the
transition happens due to a thermal instability in the inner disk on
the thermal timescale, and propagates outwards to radii
$\sim$225$r_{g}$ as in \citet{Nemmen2006}, we can parameterize the
front propagation time as
\begin{equation}
    t_{\rm front}  \sim  5 \; {\rm yrs} \left(\frac{h/r}{0.1}\right)^{-1}
                                                           \left(\frac{\alpha}{0.3}\right)^{-1}  
                                                           \left(\frac{r}{225r_{g}}\right)^{3/2}  
                                                           \frac{r_{g}}{c}
\label{eqn:t_front}
\end{equation}
where we have had to assume a higher value of $\alpha \sim 0.3$
\citep{King2007} than typically assumed for thin ($h/r \ll 1$)
disks. This is plausible if there exists a very viscous disk and the
effect propagates outwards on a timescale of $\leq 5$ years from the
inner disk.

If the viscous disk switches to a RIAF at radii $<$225$r_{g}$, then
the UV/optical emission should be supressed by several orders of
magnitude compared to a radiatively efficient thin disk
\citep{Narayan1998, Abramowicz2002, Abramowicz2013}. However, if the
thin disk emission is simply uniformly suppressed within $<225r_{g}$
by a large factor, we cannot reproduce the shape of the 2010
J1100-0053 spectrum, see Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_suppression}. Furthermore,
in order to restore the thin disk in the 2016 observation, a thermal
instability is required to occur at $\sim$225$r_{g}$ and a front to
propagate inwards, collapsing the RIAF back to a thin disk.

Noting RIAFs/ADAFs exist at lower luminosity than for a classic thin
disk ($\epsilon \sim 0.005$ and $\epsilon \sim 0.1$, respectively, for
$L=\epsilon \dot{M} c^{2}$) it is unclear first what physical
processes would trigger the change of state to an ADAF and then cool
back down to a thin disk, and second, why such an instability would
occur at the thin disk/RIAF boundary in J1100-0053, whereas in NGC
1097 this interface appears to be stable. In any case, suppressing the
MCD temperature profile inside a radius of $r_{{\rm alt}} = 225 r_{g}$
leads to a collapse in the total flux compared to unperturbed disk.
These scenarios are difficult to reconcile with our data.


\subsubsection{Changes at the ISCO and a cold absorbing phase}
An alternative explanation of our observations involves a triggering
event at the ISCO and an associated cold, absorbing or scattering
phase. Here we discuss the phenomenological requirements of this model
from the photometry in Fig.~\ref{fig:J110057_LC_CRTS}, the spectra in
Fig.~\ref{fig:J110057_spectra} and the line EWs from
Table~\ref{tab:line_ratios}. First we will outline the model fits that
are required and then we will attempt to construct a simple coherent
phenomenological picture.

The SDSS spectrum from 2000 can be well fit with a simple standard
thin accretion disk model with non-zero torque at the ISCO. The 2010
spectrum is relatively well fit with a thin disk model but now with
zero torque at the ISCO \emph{and} with a cold absorbing screen very
similar to that observed by \citep{Guo2016}. Both of these fits are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_suppression}. From
Fig.~\ref{fig:J110057_LC_CRTS}, the PanSTARRS fluxes drop strongly in
2011, particularly in the green band, and remain low until about 2014
(MJD 56800), whereupon the DECaLS green and then red fluxes climb back
upwards. By 2017, the spectrum is well fit with a zero-torque disk
model with strong grey-body suppression of the flux to $10\%$ of an
unperturbed disk at radii interior to $40r_{g}$. This can be
interpreted as a modest change in the effective temperature in the
innermost disk at $\leq$40$r_{g}$. During this time the WISE W1 and W2
flux reaches a minimum around MJD 57000 (2015) and then climbs back
towards the values from 2010. The line EWs in
Table~\ref{tab:line_ratios} imply that the broad lines are actually
stronger in 2010 than in 2017.

    Cartoon illustration of our model explaining the unusual spectral
evolution of J1100-0053. In 2000, corresponding to the SDSS spectral
epoch, the quasar has a standard inflated accretion disk, i.e., where
non-zero torque at the ISCO heats the inner radii of the accretion
disk, causing it to puff up \citep[e.g.,][]{Zimmerman2005}. Just
before the 2010 spectrum, a triggering event occurs that deflates the
inner disk, possibly due to a shift in the magnetic field
configuration leading to zero torque at the ISCO.  This event is
associated with some scattering/absorbing cold phase clouds, and
causes a cooling front to propagate outwards in the accretion disk,
traveling on the $t_{\rm front}$ time-scale \citep[see
also][]{Hameury2009}.  Circa 2014, a heating front travels radially
inwards, re-heating the inner accretion disk but on longer timescales,
due to the thinner disk. We predict that in the next year, the quasar
should roughly return to its initial state.}
  \label{fig:J110057_cartoon}
\end{figure*}
Putting all this together into a simple phenomenological model
suggests the following course of events, which we depict in cartoon
form in Fig.~\ref{fig:J110057_cartoon}.  Conditions change around
2010 at the ISCO and this change is associated with a cold absorbing
or scattering phase. Since the broad lines are relatively strong in
2010, the change occurs several months before the spectrum is
taken. The triggering event may be a change in $\dot{M}$, due to a
stochastic variation in the mass supply or a local change in
$\alpha$. Since accretion disk luminosity is probably powered by
magnetized gas losing angular momentum, magnetized gas in the plunging
region might be expected to torque the ISCO gas \citep[e.g.,
][]{Gammie1999, Agol_Krolik2000}. If there is a change in the magnetic
field configuration around the SMBH, such that the torque decreases to
near zero, the temperature of the innermost disk will drop
dramatically \citep{Cao2003}.  We speculate that just such a change
occurs not long before the 2010 spectrum is taken. 

Associated with a
change at the ISCO, we require a cold, absorbing and/or scattering
phase. There are several possible sources of such a cold phase. A
scattering phase might arise from the collapse of a corona. Or a cold
phase could appear in the helical outflowing wind which generates the
innermost broad line region (BLR). A dramatic change in disk surface
opacity might also be responsible, or some combination of all three of
these. So while in 2000 only one model component is needed to fit the
spectrum, namely a thin disk with non-zero torque at the ISCO, in 2010
two model components are required; a thin disk with zero-torque at the
ISCO \emph{and} a cold absorbing/scattering screen. The 2010 spectrum
can not be fit with any variety of greybody absorption, or
equivalently a simple MCD model with an alternate temperature
profile. It is however, reasonably well fit using the wavelength
dependent absorption model of \citep{Guo2016}.

The photometric data in Fig.~\ref{fig:J110057_LC_CRTS} require a
further drop of around a magnitude in the PanSTARRS colours by
2011. We can achieve this by keeping the two-component model from
2010, but by adding a third component, a greybody suppression out to
$\sim$100$r_{g}$. We speculate that a cooling front propagates outwards
in the disk from the changes at the ISCO in 2010 so that regions of
the disk that contribute strongly to green and red emission are
suppressed by 2011. A cooling front propagates at speed $v_{\rm
front}=\alpha c_{\rm s}$ \citep{Hameury2009} so $\alpha \geq
0.1(c_{s}/10^{4}{\rm km/s})$ is required, but with $v_{\rm front}$
slowing the farther it travels since $c_{s}$ is expected to fall
rapidly with increasing radius \citep{Sirko_Goodman2003}.

By 2014, the PanSTARRS green and red fluxes begin recovery. This may
be associated with the inward propagation of a heating instability
\citep{Hameury2009}. For example, if $\Sigma$ reaches a critical
value, a heating front can propagate back inwards, analogous to the
well-known accretion disk limit cycle mechanism in models of dwarf
novae outbursts \citep[e.g.,][]{Cannizzo1998}. The returning heating
front travels more slowly because the disk is colder, thinner (and
$t_{\rm front}$ is inversely proportional to $h/r$). However, the
heating from will re-inflate the disk as it propagates inwards towards
the SMBH. As a result the recovery to 2010 fluxes in the PanSTARRS
bands will take longer than the drop from 2010-2011.

While the cooling/heating has been going on in the accretion disk, the
initial dimming of the central ionizing flux will have an effect on
the distant (parsec-scale) torus. After a light travel time of $\sim
3$ years the IR flux from the torus should drop \citep{Koshida2014,
Jun2015b} beginning in 2013, dropping to a minimum in 2014-15 (since
the disk is most suppressed in 2011 and the PanSTARRS band recover
slightly or remain flat in 2012-13). We speculate that the absorbing
screen has dissipated by this epoch in order to match the IR minimum
in 2015. This seems to be consistent with the behaviour of the source
in the WISE W1 and W2 bands. The cooling/heating front disk
propagation, the connection and origin of the BLR, and the effect on
the inner dust has also recently been explored in
\citet{Baskin_Laor2018}.

Assuming that nothing else drastic happens, our model predicts that
the heating front returns to the ISCO in late 2018 (around now). That
means the broad Balmer lines will reach a maximum a few months later
in early 2019, but the WISE IR flux should return to full flux in
2021. 

If the cold phase is associated with the condensation or disappearance
of part of the inner BLR, then the maximum EWs in 2019 may still be
less than the EWs measured in 2010. We also note that if J1100-0053 is
an ``anomalous H$\beta$ quasar'' as suggested by
\citet{Steinhardt_Silverman2013} and described above, then the
variable linewidths can be explained by the disk going into a low
state and the innermost, fastest, outflow disappears (due to e.g.,
reduced radiation pressure). 
%%
However, we have not been able to constrain the behaviour of H$\beta$ in J2317+0005 during the downturn observed by \citep{Guo_2016}. Therefore it is not clear whether there is a general link between a broad H$\beta$ component and an apparent state change in the CLQ disk.  
%Future studies of state changes in CLQs should therefore monitor both the broad lines and the continuum at high cadence.
As such, we note this potentially intriguing
behaviour of the H$\beta$ emission line and look to investigate
further in the context of the ``changing-look'' phenomenon in a future
demographic study.

By 2017, the returning heating front has propagated back in to
$\sim$40$r_{g}$ and the cold phase has disappeared. So it seems the
cold phase is required between 2010-13, but then has fully disappeared
by 2017. This is an important constraint on the nature of the cold
phase which is an important but poorly understood component in our
phenomenological model. If for example, the cold phase clumps on
size-scales of order $r_g$, with an overdensity of $10^{4}$ relative
to their hotter surroundings, and a relative velocity compared to the
hot phase on the order of the orbital velocity, then the clumps are
unstable to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
(eqn.~\ref{eqn:T_cloudcrushing}) on an approximate timescale of
\begin{equation}
t_{{\rm cc}} \approx 3{\rm mo} 
               \left( \frac{\rho_{\rm{cloud}}/\rho_{\rm{medium}}}{10^{4}}   \right)^{1/2}
               \left( \frac{r_{\rm cloud}}{r_{g}}\right) 
              \left( \frac{v_{\rm rel}}{10^{4}\rm{km s^{-1}}} \right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
The important point here is that cold phase clouds are unstable to
collapse after a short time unless they are extremely over-dense with
very cold cores relative to the surrounding medium. The main coolants
at low temperatures are C,O resonance lines and H and He from neutral
phase material \citep[see e.g., Fig. 18 in
][]{Sutherland_Dopita1993}. The ionization energies for carbon and
oxygen are 11.26 and 13.61 eV, respectively, i.e., $\sim 100$nm, and
hence at wavelengths $<100$nm the disk opacity will increase
dramatically in edges. In the inner gas disk such edges must be
pressure, turbulence and Doppler broadened, but to depress the flux
out to $\sim 300$nm would require associated velocities of $\sim
0.9$c. Thus, cooling absorption edges could explain the cold absorbing
phase only if substantial blanketing material is flung out from near
the event horizon, but this would not match the mild, longer
wavelength absorption required in \citep{Guo2016} or our
source. Rayleigh scattering might also help explain the steep cut-off
in the 2010 spectrum; we might expect an additional scattering layer
from slightly larger ions or neutral atoms in a cold or condensing
phase from the corona or the BLR. However, we cannot take a strong
position on the identity of the absorber without more data, especially
time resolved spectra of an entire event such as this.

\section{Conclusions} 
By monitoring changing look quasars we introduce new
tests of models of accretion disk physics. We present the 
quasar J1100-0053 that was catalogued in the Sloan Digital 
Sky Survey quasar survey, but identified as an interesting due 
to its near-infrared photometric properties. 

We have shown that a simple
phenomenological model with a propagating cooling front is capable of
describing the gross spectral and temporal variations in a changing
looking quasar. Our model makes a prediction for this source, testable
over the next few years and, if confirmed, implies that changing
looking quasars as a class are driven by changes near the ISCO, close
to the SMBH. The discovery of J1100-0053 (and J2317+0005) are specific
key examples of time-domain astronomy and the resulting astrophysics
to be studied. However, even with the coverage from WISE, PanSTARRS,
SDSS, DECaLS and CRTS, we have a relatively sparse dataset which
cannot tightly constrain our theoretical model. 

The Zwicky Transient
Facility \citep[ZTF; ][]{Bellm2014} has very recently started and will
open a new data space with high cadence, multi-band photometric
monitoring. Along with ZTF in the very near future, the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope \citep{Ivezic2008, LSST_ScienceBookV2} will allow
identification of the types of events such as J1100-0053 and
J2317+0005 \emph{while they are occurring}, allowing spectroscopic
monitoring. We will be able to see how long a UV collapse lasts and
closely follow its evolution.  Such data will stringently test models
of AGN disks at much higher fidelity than we are able to do with
current `Changing-Look' quasar samples.
