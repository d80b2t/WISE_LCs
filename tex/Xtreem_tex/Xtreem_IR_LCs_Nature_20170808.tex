\begin{abstract}
Quasars are some of the most luminous objects in our Universe and are believed to play an important role in galaxy formation and the growth of the largest black holes. While variability has long been recognized as a characteristic feature of quasars, astronomers have only recently identified extreme quasar variability; dramatic changes in either the brightness or spectral characteristics of sources.  In particular, a new class of ``changing-look quasars’' have recently been identified where the strong UV continuum and broad hydrogen emission lines associated with "unobscured" quasars either appear or disappear on timescales of several years.  The physical processes, responsible for such changes are still debated, but fundamental changes in the quasar, such as the black hole accretion rate appear more likely than changes in obscuration, at least for quasars showing extreme mid-infrared variability.  Here we report on three epochs of spectroscopy of SDSS~J110057.70-005304.5, an extreme mid-infrared variable quasar at $z = 0.378$ whose UV continuum and broad hydrogen emission lines have dramatically faded over the past 20 years.  Uniquely, an archival spectrum of this quasar from 2010 shows an intermediate phase of the transition, when the flux below rest-frame $\sim 3400$~\AA\ has collapsed, suggestive of dramatic changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk. This provides not only important clues to the physics of changing-look quasars, but also a prediction that the Hβ flux will increase in the next few months.

%\section{Introduction}

Shortly after their initial identification \citep{Schmidt63,
Hazard63}, quasars were seen to vary photometrically. This placed
strict limits on the size of the central engine power source and gave
credence to the idea that a supermassive black hole powers AGN.

If the accretion disc is in a stable steady state, we expect it to
evolve gradually on the inward drift timescale set by viscosity, which
is of the order 10,000 years \citep[see e.g., ][]{Netzer13,
Lawrence16}. However, instabilities of various kinds could give much
faster changes. The `light crossing' timescale $t_{\rm lt} = R/c$, is
the shortest timescale set by radiation heating or reflection. This is
of the order hours, days, and years for disc, BLR, and torus
respectively. The `dynamical timescale', $t_{\rm dyn} = R^{3}/GM$, is
the shortest timescale on which we are likely to see significant
physical changes in a region, and is of the order of days, years, and
thousands of years for disc, BLR, and torus respectively. (The
`free-fall' timescale is roughly the same and orbital timescale is
$2\pi$ times longer.) More realistically, perturbations may transmit
across a region on the sound crossing timescale $t_{\rm snd} =
R/v_{\rm snd}$. This is somewhat model dependent but is of the order
of years for the accretion disc. This is the global time to cross the
whole region; local hot spots could grow on the timescale it takes
sound to cross the vertical height of the disc, which can be 1–3
orders of magnitude faster. The ``thermal'' timescale $t_{\rm therm}$
which is roughly the time it takes for for energy to dissipate within
the disc, i.e. the response timescale to a spike of energy input. It
is of the order of days for the inner disc and years for the optical
disc. The analogous ``response'' timescale for the BLR and for the
obscuring region is actually the light-crossing time - the local
response time to a change in photo-ionisation or heating is very
short, but is smeared out by the range of light travel delays.

Although the observed variability of quasars has been known since
shortly after their discovery, only recently, with the advent of
extensive imaging surveys and the associated, repeat spectroscopy, has
given actual evidence for these key physical mechanisms.

In this article we present the $z=0.378$ quasar SDSS
J110057.70-005304.5 that we have observed transitioning from a blue
continuum sloped object to become a regular galaxy. However, along
with the changes in the BELs, we see a major change to the disk
interior to 150$R_{g}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:J110057_LC_CRTS} gives the optical light curve of

Checking the data archives we found there was 
no source within 30 arcsec in the VLA FIRST, i.e., at 21 cm radio frequencies.
%% Catalog detection limit (including CLEAN bias) at source position is 1.11 mJy/beam

None of the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope} or 
the {\it Kepler} Mission has observed J110057 patch of sky. It is also not in 
the HSC DR1 footprint. 

There is a detection in ROSAT, using the 2nd all-sky survey (2RXS; Boller et al. 2016, A\&A, 588, 103)
as 2RXS J110058.1-005259 with 27.00 counts (count error 6.14), count rate= 0.06$\pm$0.01
and an exposure time of = 431.95 seconds. 
The NED gives J110057 as $1.27\pm0.28 \times^{-12}$ erg/cm$^{2$}/s in
the 0.1-2.4 keV range (unabsorbed flux). J110057Neither {\it Chandra} or {\it XMM-Newton}.

\section{Discussion}   %% (without subheadings)
Using Ford et al and Sirko \& Goodman 2003, 
Figure~\ref{fig:model} shows a model for a $M_{\rm BH}=3\times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$, 
radiative efficiency of $\epsilon=0.1$, accretion rate in units of Eddington accretion, 
$\dot{M}=0.032$, inner and outer disk radii in units of $r_g$ of SMBH of 
radius$_{\rm in}$=6.0, radius$_{\rm out}$=1.0$\times 10^{4}$.
