\begin{abstract}
We present the mid-infrared light-curves for 248 quasars that show
large, $>$0.5 mag peak-to-peak, variation in either the WISE W1 or W2
(3.4 or 4.6 $\mu$m) bands. Our motivation is to quantify and
understand the ubiquity and processes involved in luminous AGN
obscuration.  The quasars are part of the SDSS-I/II or SDSS-III: BOSS
Quasar surveys, a superset of over 200,000 objects with at least one
epoch of spectroscopy. The IR light curves are from the WISE, NEOWISE
and NEOWISE-R missions.
%%
Critically we employ new DECaLS data, and find objects that were
`traditional' blue quasars (and appear so in SDSS imaging) but turn
red in color in DECaLS, and are often now seen as extended.
%%
In particular, we present the $z=0.378$ quasar SDSS
J110057.70-005304.5 as a quasar that is tranistioning from a blue
continuum sloped object to become a ``Changing-Look'' quasar -- with the
prominence of the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ broad-emission lines being
dramatically reduced. What makes J110057 particularly interesting,
however, is (by selection) its associated short-term IR variablity,
and dramatic reddening in the optical continuum during the transition
to its non-broad line state.
%%
{\bf (TBD!!)} We explore simple models of quasar obscuration, and
given the short observed timescales ($\approx$7 years in the rest
frame) find it very hard to explain this behaviour.

\section{Introduction}
The reprocessing of UV/optical photons by micron sized carbonates and
silicates around an AGN central engine leads to the prodigious emission
of infrared (IR) emission (\citet[See][for review on AGN infrared
emission]{Elitzur14}; \citet[][for a review on the Unified Model of
Active Galactic Nuclei]{Netzer15} and \citet[][]{Draine03} for a
review on dust).
%% All these References will need to be fixed/heavily updated.

With the energy released by the accretion of material onto a galactic
central engine black hole being comparable to the energy released in
nuclear fusion (REFs!!) having a full accounting of the bolometric
output from a luminous AGN, i.e. a quasar, is a critical part of any
contemporary galaxy and AGN model and evolutionary theory (e.g. current
Illustrious and EAGLE refs??). Thus, identifying AGN in the IR, and in
particular at $\sim$10$\mu$m where the AGN contribution to the SED
peaks (REFs) is of key interest. Indeed, many studies have explored
the utilization of mid-IR (3-30$mu$m rest) to identify and characterize
AGN and quasars \citep{Lacy04, Stern05, Martinez-Sansigre06,
Richards09b, Donley12, Stern12, Banerji13, Assef13, Richards15,
Timlin16}. 

Along with the raw energy output, of further critical importance to
understanding in detail the physical processes of the AGN, and the
potential for ``feedback'' on the host galaxy, is the time-dependent
nature of the obscuring, dusty material. Although this is thought to
be a dusty rotating ``torodial'' structure on $\sim$parsec scales,
apart from a few very local case studies (e.g. VLT MIR interferometry
objects) we are currently very ignorant to the geometry and topology
of the AGN IR emitting region.

As such, observing, and characterizing the MIR {\it light curves} (LCs) of
luminous AGN, would garnish major clues into the variable nature of
the energy output of the central engine, along with key tests and
constraints on the ``AGN unified model''.

In this paper, we use the data from the Wide-Field
Infrared Survey Explorer \citep[WISE; ][]{Wright10}, and in particular
the NEOWISE-R mission \citep{Mainzer14, Meisner16}, combined with the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalogs \citep[DR7Q][]{Schneider10}
and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey \citep[DECaLS][]{Lang16} to
identify 105 quasars (from a sample of 105,000) with large changes,
$|\Delta$ mag$|>0.5$, in their MIR LCs. 

\citet{Kozlowski2010} and use the multi-epoch, mid-infrared Spitzer
Deep Wide-Field Survey to investigate the variability of objects in
8.1 deg2 of the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey Boötes field.  These
authors perform a difference image analysis of the four available
epochs between 2004 and 2008, over 8.1 deg$^2$, focusing on the deeper
3.6 and 4.5 μm bands. Out of 474,179 analyzed sources, 1.1\% meet
their standard variability selection criteria that the two light
curves are strongly correlated and that their joint variance exceeds
that for all sources with the same magnitude by 2$\sigma$.
\citet{Kozlowski2016} redo this analysis with a longer baseline.

In Section 2 we describe our datasets and methods for finding the MIR
variable quasars, including false positive checks. In Section 3 we
present our sample and the place the Extreme-IR Changers in context of
the general QSO population. In Section 4 we {\it potentially} say
``something'' about obscuration rates and draw our conclusions. 
The (online) Appendix gives the full details or our sample. 
%%
Because of established conventions, we report SDSS magnitudes on the
AB zero-point system \citep{Oke83, Fukugita96}, while the WISE
magnitudes are calibrated on the Vega system \citep{Wright10}.

\section{Data}
We utilize three large datasets for our investigations: the 5-band,
optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; all the usual refs), the
3-band optical Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey
\citep[DECaLS]{Lang16}, and data from the WISE mission. Crucially,
data from all three surveys is combined, details of which can be found
at \href{legacysurvey.org}{\tt legacysurvey.org}. We summarize the
salient details here.

\subsection{Optical Data}
    \subsubsection{SDSS and SDSS-III: BOSS}
    The SDSS is described in full detail elsewhere \citep{Fukugita96,
      Gunn98, York00, Hogg01, Lupton01, Stoughton02, Smith02, Pier03,
      Ivezic04, Gunn06, Tucker06, Padmanabhan08a}. The third incarnation of
    the SDSS, SDSS-III is described in \citet{Eisenstein11} with the
    Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) being detailed in
    \citet{Dawson13}. The final data release paper from SDSS-III was the
    Data Release 12 \citep{DR12}.
    
    We use the SDSS Seventh Data Release Quasar Catalog
    \citep[DR7Q;][]{Schneider10, Shen11} and the SDSS-III Twelve Data
    Release \citep[DR12Q;][]{Paris2017}. SDSS quasar targets with
    $i\leq19.1$ were selected if the colors were consistent with being at
    redshift $z\lesssim3$, and $i\leq20.2$ objects were selected if
    $z\gtrsim$3, as outlined in \citet{Richards02}. BOSS quasar targets
    are selected to a magnitude limit of $g \leq 22.0$ or $r\leq 21.85$,
    with the primary goal to select quasars in the redshift range $2.2\leq
    z \leq 3.5$ as described by \citet[][and references
    therein]{Ross12}. In both SDSS and BOSS, quasar targets are also
    selected if they are matched within 2$''$ (1$''$ in the case of BOSS)
    of an object in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST)
    catalog of radio sources \citep{Becker95}. Both the SDSS DR7Q and
    BOSS DR12Q include quasars that were selected by algorithms other than
    the main quasar selections; these sources appear in the catalog due
    to being targeted by the respective galaxy selections, being a
    `serendipitous' \citep{Stoughton02} or `special' \citep{DR4} target in
    SDSS, or an `ancillary' target in BOSS \citep[][]{Dawson13, DR12, DR13}.
    
    \subsubsection{DECaLS: Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey}
    The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey \citep[DECaLS; ][]{Lang16} is
    taking deep 3-band $g,r,z$ imaging over 10,000deg of the Northern Sky
    that is accessible from the Cerro Tololo International Observatory
    site. As of writing the DECaLS is ongoing.
    %% with the latest data release being    the Data Release 3 (DECaLS DR3). 
        
\subsection{Infrared Data}
As noted in \citet{Mainzer14} and \citet{Meisner16}, after its initial
launch, cryogenic mission, and a period of hibernation, the WISE
satellite was reactivated, and recommenced surveying the sky in its
two shorter wavebands, $W1$ and $W2$.  This W1/W2 survey is referred
to as NEOWISE-Reactivation or NEOWISER.
    
We directly use the data from \citet{Meisner16} which employs an
adaptation of the unWISE \citet{Lang14} image coaddition framework.
    
From the Tractor catalog column descriptions, you will
see that DR3 includes sparse WISE W1/W2 light curves for every
optically detected source (WISE\_LC*). These WISE light-curves are
measured by forced-photometry of time-resolved unWISE coadds.
Currently, in the DECaLS footprint, there are typically four epochs,
sometimes five, and very rarely only three. These light curves
typically span a $\sim$4-5 year time baseline, $\sim$2010-2014.

Figure~\ref{fig:maxmin_err} is the distribution of (max-min)/error in
the MIR fluxes.  (Should also be looking at the SDSS stars as a
control sample (don’t have those on my laptop).  The WISE magnitude
range for those stars will be quite different, though, since they have
the same optical magnitude range but are fainter in WISE.)



%%  N. B. !!  N. B. !!   N. B. !!  N. B. !! 
%%  This is text from Aaron's email from 15th Feb, 2017, sent to Daniel, 
%%  for the WISE J1052+1519 outline/paper
%%
W1 and W2 lightcurves for $\sim$200,000 SDSS spectroscopic quasars
were extracted from Data Release 3 (DR3) of the Dark Energy Camera
Legacy Survey (DECaLS). These light curves span from the beginning of
the WISE mission (2010 January) through the first-year of NEOWISER
operations (2014 December). In detail, the W1/W2 light curves are
obtained by performing forced photometry at the locations of
DECam-detected optical sources. This forced photometry is performed on
time-resolved unWISE coadds, each of which represents a stack with
depth of coverage $\sim$12 exposures. A given sky location is observed
by WISE for $\sim$1 day once every six months, which means that our
forced photometry light curves typically have four coadd epochs
available. Coadd epochs of a given object are separated by a minimum
of six months and a maximum of four years. Our coaddition removes the
possibility of probing variability on $\lesssim$1 day time scales, but
it allows us to push $\sim$1.4 magnitudes deeper than individual
exposures while removing virtually all single-exposure artifacts
(e.g. cosmic rays and satellites).

$\sim$30,000 of the SDSS quasars with such W1/W2 lightcurves available
are ``IR-bright'', in the sense that they are above both the W1 and W2
single exposure thresholds and therefore detected at very high
significance in our coadds. For this ensemble of objects, the typical
variation in each quasar's measured (W1-W2) color is 0.06 magnitudes,
which includes statistical and systematic errors expected to
contribute variations at the few hundredths of a mag level. The
typical measured single-band scatter is 0.07 magnitudes in each of W1
and W2. A full characterization of the typical mid-IR quasar
variability will be presented separately (Ross et al., in
preparation).

We undertook a search for extreme outliers relative to these trends.
Specifically, we selected objects with the following characterisitcs.

% itemize type stuff
\begin{itemize}
\item Monotonic variation in both W1 and W2.
\item W1 versus W2 \textit{flux} correlation coefficient $>$0.9.
\item $>0.5$ mag peak-to-peak variation in either W1 or W2.
\end{itemize}

This yielded a sample of 248 sources. 31 of these are assumed to be blazars 
due to the presence of FIRST radio counterparts. Another 22 are outside of the 
FIRST  footprint, leaving 195 quasars in our IR-variable sample. We randomly 
selected five of these objects for follow-up spectroscopy with Palomar DBSP on
the night of 30 January 2017. WISE J1052+1519, one of these five, 
faded by 0.75 (0.9) mags in W1 (W2), and thus became 0.15 mags bluer in 
(W1-W2), making it a significant outlier in both single-band and IR color 
variability.

A link to the key properties of our sample can be

{\tt found here} and the catalogs are here:
\href{http://portal.nersc.gov/project/cosmo/temp/ameisner/dr3_wise_lc_sample.fits.gz}{dr3\_wise\_lc\_sample.fits.gz}
\href{http://portal.nersc.gov/project/cosmo/temp/ameisner/dr3_wise_lc_metrics_all_qso.fits.gz}{dr3\_wise\_lc\_sample.fits.gz}.
The first catalog has 248 rows, which are the selected highly
IR-variable sample of objects.  The second catalog is the full
\hbox{200 622} quasar sample quasars that have ``good'' WISE light
curves available in DECaLS DR3. In each file, there are 3 extensions:
ex = 0 -- WISE light curve summary metrics; ex = 1 -- DECaLS DR3
Tractor data for each object; ex = 2 -- SDSS data for each object.

$(W1-W2)$ color, which is pretty narrow. Overplotted is a Gaussian
distribution, centered at -3.8 mmag and with standard deviation of
0.06 mags (with a fit-by-eye ;-)

This histogram includes $\sim$37,500 data points from $\sim$9000
bright quasars, that is, brighter than single-exposure detection limit in both
W1 and W2. 
% Let me know what you think. I can also try splitting by FIRST versus no FIRST.

    {\it NPR: It'd be very most awesome if we could show a
      W1W2W3 RGB image of a quasar changing color!!!}

    (I would guess this is real variation, but I'm still a little bit scared that

    that imprint onto the fluxes.)

\subsection{SDSS J110057.71-005304.5}
Figures~\ref{fig::lc_J110057} presents the IR NEOWISER light curve for 
J110057, and~\ref{fig:finder_J110057} the IR finding charts. 


SDSS J110057.71-005304.5, hereafter J110057, was discovered by 
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2000. 
 J110057 was imaged in Run 756 (which makes up Stripe 10), 
and satisfied a number of spectroscopic targettings flags
\footnote{SERENDIP\_BLUE, ROSAT\_D,  ROSAT\_C,  ROSAT\_B, QSO\_SKIRT, ROSAT\_A, 
see \citet{EDR} and \citet{Richards02} for flag desciptions.}
making it a quasar target. A spectrum was obtain on MJD 51908, on Plate 
277, Fiber 212, and the spectrum of a $z=0.378\pm0.00003$ was

In the DECaLS, the DECaLS brick containing J110057.71-005304.5.
There are 8, 3 and 9 exposures in the $g-$, $r-$ and $z-$band 
respectively. 
$56707.146 \leq g_{\rm MJD} \leq  56727.201$;  
$56367.091 \leq  r_{\rm MJD} \leq  56367.230$; 
$56383.159 \leq  z_{\rm MJD} \leq  57398.350$. 

As can be seen, the $g-$ and $r-$band observations have fairly limited
time spans, and are separated by roughly a year. The $z$-band
observations span almost 3 years.  The DESI imaging brick name is
1651m010.
%%  I've attached the CCDs file, which comes from:
%%  /project/projectdirs/cosmo/data/legacysurvey/dr3.1/coadd/165/1651m010/legacysurvey-1651m010-ccds.fits

Second epoch spectrum is from BOSS and has a dramatic downturn at 
$\lesssim$4300\AA\ . 

A third epoch spectrum was obtained from the Palomar 5m 
telescope using the DBSP instrument. 
Two exposures of 600s+300s were taken in good conditions. 
%%
Feature to note include: the continuum straddling MgII
being blue in the 2017 spectrum, as it was for the SDSS spectrum in 2000, as opposed to
red, as it was for the BOSS spectrum in 2010.
