\begin{abstract}
Changing-look quasars are a new class of recently identified object in
which the strong UV continuum and broad optical hydrogen emission
lines associated with unobscured quasars either appear or disappear on
timescales of years \cite{LaMassa15, Runnoe16, MacLeod16, Ruan16}. The
physical processes responsible for this behaviour are still debated,
but changes in the black hole accretion rate or accretion disk
structure appear more likely than changes in
obscuration\cite{Hutsemekers17, Sheng17}. Here we report on three
epochs of spectroscopy of SDSS J110057.70-005304.5, a quasar whose UV
continuum and broad hydrogen emission lines have dramatically faded
over the past 20 years. An archival spectrum of this quasar from 2010
shows an intermediate phase of the transition during which the flux
below rest-frame 340nm has collapsed. This is unique compared to
previously published examples of changing-look quasars, and is best
explained by dramatic changes in the innermost regions of the
accretion disk. The optical continuum has been rising again since
mid-2016, leading to a prediction of a rise in hydrogen emission line
flux in the next few months. If our model is confirmed, the physics of
`changing look' quasars are governed by processes at the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole, and the structure
of the innermost disk. Thus, the easily identifiably and monitored
Changing Look Quasars would then provide a new probe of the strong
gravity regime.

%\section{Introduction}

The ``Changing-Look'' quasar phenomenon, where the dramatic
disappearance, or appearance, of prominent broad optical emission
lines is seen on year timescales, is now widely observed,
\cite{LaMassa15, MacLeod16, Runnoe16, Ruan16, Gezari17, Rumbaugh17}.
yet poorly understood.
%If the disappearance of the broad emission lines observed in changing-look quasars were caused by the obscuration of the quasar core through moving dust clouds in the torus, high linear polarization typical of type 2 quasars would be expected.
\citet{Hutsemekers17} find a polarization degree compatible with null
polarization suggesting that the observed change of look is not due to
a change of obscuration hiding the continuum source and the broad line
region.  Meanwhile, \cite{Sheng17} using the mid-infrared luminosity
during the transitions in 10 changing-look AGNs from the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and find that the CL behavior of their
sample cannot be a result of the changes in obscuration.  However, it
is clear that the CLQs are a key laboratory into understanding
accretion physics and the nature of the AGN broad line region (BLR).

The famous $\alpha-$disk model \cite{SS73} for a optically thick,
geometrically thin disk ($h / R) \ll 1$; where $h$ is the vertical
scale height of the disk) is known to have serious short-comings
e.g. \cite{Antonucci99, Koratkar_Blaes99, Lawrence12} AGN seem to be
cooler than they ought to be \cite[e.g., ]{Lawrence12} with the SEDs
of AGN showing a universal near-UV shape, reaching a maximum in $\nu
S_{\nu}$ around 1100\AA\ , Such a peak suggests a characteristic
temperature of T$\sim$30 000K, wheres for a thermal model, the
characteristic temperature should be roughly T$\sim$100 000K.
Moreover, constraints from microlensing observartions for the size of
the optical emission region \cite[e.g., ]{Pooley07, Morgan10,
Morgan12, Mosquera11} suggestion this region is larger than the one
predicted by the standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk.

CLQs have traditionally been discovered by looking for large, $|
\Delta m | >1$ magnitude changes in the optical light curves (e.g. in
the $g$-band). However, we have taken advantage of the ongoing
Near-Earth Object WISE Reactivation mission
(NEOWISE-R)\cite{Mainzer14, Meisner17, Meisner17b}, as well as the
Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS\footnote{{\tt
legacysurvey.org/decamls/}}) in order to discover new CLQs. Our team
is the first to extend this selection to the infrared using NEOWISE-R
mission data. Indeed, we have found a sample of SDSS quasars that show
{\it dramatic decreases in their IR flux over the course of a few
years.}  These changes are on timescales too short to be considered
due to changes in obscuration, so a new explanation is needed.

In this article we present the $z=0.378$ quasar SDSS
J110057.70-005304.5 that we have observed transitioning from a blue
continuum sloped object to become a regular galaxy. However, along
with the changes in the BELs, we see a major change to the disk
interior to 150$R_{g}$.

\section{Results}  
%% \subsection(Results subheadings, if needed}
Matching the SDSS/BOSS Data Release 12 Quasar catalog ( \href{DR12Q;
}{Paris17)} to the NEOWISE-R IR data (W1 is 3.4$\mu$m, W2 is
4.6$\mu$m) our team found $\approx$200 objects with fading light IR
light curves. These objects were identified by a factor of 2 or more
drop in the observed WISE W1 and W2 bands.

Figure~\ref{fig:J110057_LC_CRTS} gives the optical light curve of
J110057.  Figure~\ref{fig:J110057_spectra} shows the three optical
spectra of J110057. 

Checking the data archives we found there was 
no source within 30 arcsec in the VLA FIRST, i.e., at 21 cm radio frequencies.
%catalog detection limit (including CLEAN bias) at source position is 1.11 mJy/beam
None of the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, the {\it Spitzer Space
Telescope} or the {\it Kepler} Mission has observed J110057 patch of
sky. It is also not in the HSC DR1 footprint.  There is a detection in
ROSAT, using the 2nd all-sky survey (2RXS; Boller et al. 2016, A\&A,
588, 103) as 2RXS J110058.1-005259 with 27.00 counts (count error
6.14), count rate= 0.06$\pm$0.01 and an exposure time of = 431.95
seconds.  The NED gives J110057 as $1.27\pm0.28 \times^{-12}$
erg/cm$^{2}$/s in the 0.1-2.4 keV range (unabsorbed
flux). J110057Neither {\it Chandra} or {\it XMM-Newton}.

Figure~\ref{fig:J110057_spectra} shows the optical spectra for J110057
from the SDSS, the BOSS and Palomar observations taken on MJD 51908,
55302, and 57809. The MJD 51908 SDSS spectrum is of a typical blue quasar, 
the blue continuum then collapses

\section{Discussion}   %% (without subheadings)
Our preliminary models (Fig.~3) of emission from a multicolor disk
imply changes from the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) to
$\sim$few tens-100 $R_{\rm g}$ are required to suppress flux into the
observed $g$-band. In particular, we suggest a physical collapse of
the disk scale height due to a cooling front propagating outward from
the ISCO. If the inner accretion disk is usually inflated (see
e.g. Sirko \& Goodman 2003, Thompson et al. 2005, Hopkins \& Quataert
2011), such a cooling front will naturally produce: 1) a collapse in
the scale height of the disk; 2) a decrease in flux moving from UV to
longer optical wavelengths; 3) a temporarily thicker scattering
atmosphere, further decreasing flux at short wavelengths. {\it This
model implies changes to the optical emission moving from shorter to
longer wavelengths (as the radius of the cooling front increases), on
months-to-years-long timescales.} It also predicts a longer time to
recover the original flux (compared to the initial collapse, as a
front will move more slowly in a thinner disk (see Fig.~2). A decrease
in the UV flux would also be expected to cause a decrease in IR flux,
as the heating of the IR-emitting dusty torus is reduced; however,
there should also be a delay due to light travel time.

Using Ford et al and Sirko \& Goodman 2003, Figure~\ref{fig:model}
shows a model for a $M_{\rm BH}=3\times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$, radiative
efficiency of $\epsilon=0.1$, accretion rate in units of Eddington
accretion, $\dot{M}=0.032$, inner and outer disk radii in units of
$r_g$ of SMBH of radius$_{\rm in}$=6.0, radius$_{\rm out}$=1.0$\times
10^{4}$.

\cite{Guo16} observed a similar event to J110057, with SDSS
J231742.60 +000535.1. However, their object provided an ambiguous
case, as the IR brightness of their source did not decline. However
this is consistent with our model, as their cooling event is
relatively brief.
