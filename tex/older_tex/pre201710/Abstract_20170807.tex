We present the $z=0.378$ quasar SDSS J110057.70-005304.5 as a quasar
that is transitioning from a blue continuum sloped object to become a
``Changing-Look'' quasar -- with the prominence of the H$\beta$ and
H$\gamma$ broad-emission lines being dramatically reduced. What makes
J110057 particularly interesting, however, is (by selection) its
associated short-term IR variability, and dramatic reddening in the
optical continuum during the transition to its non-broad line state.

{\bf (TBD!!)} We explore simple models of quasar obscuration, and
given the short observed timescales ($\approx$7 years in the rest-frame) 
find it very hard to explain this behavior.
