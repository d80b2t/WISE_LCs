# README for d80b2t/WISE_LCs/tex

Okay, I've finally put the .tex, in all's it lorem ipsum glory out here. 
The WISE QSOs and Light Curve project(s) isn't fully on this github repo (yet).

Files can also be found on Overleaf:

## emulateapj.cls vs. revtex4-1 vs. lscape
If you are having  trouble with the pages coming out sideways,
i.e. in landscape mode, disable \usepackage{lscape}
(these a clash between the lscape package and revtex4-1...)
