\begin{abstract}
We present the $z=0.378$ quasar SDSS J110057.70-005304.5 as a quasar
that is transitioning from a blue continuum sloped object to become a
``Changing-Look'' quasar -- with the prominence of the H$\beta$ and
H$\gamma$ broad-emission lines being dramatically reduced. What makes
J110057 particularly interesting, however, is (by selection) its
associated short-term IR variability, and dramatic reddening in the
optical continuum during the transition to its non-broad line state.
%%
{\bf (TBD!!)} We explore simple models of quasar obscuration, and
given the short observed timescales ($\approx$7 years in the rest-frame) 
find it very hard to explain this behavior.

%\section{Introduction}
Shortly after their initial identification \citep{Schmidt63, Hazard63}, quasars were 
seen to vary photometrically. This placed strict limits on the size of the 
central engine power source and gave credence to the idea that a 
supermassive black hole powers AGN. 

From e.g., Lawerence (2016, ASPC):: 
If the accretion disc is in a stable steady state, we expect it to
evolve gradually on the inward drift timescale set by viscosity, which
is of the order 10,000 years (see e.g. Netzer (2013)). However,
instabilities of various kinds could give much faster changes. The
`light crossing' timescale $t_{\rm lt} = R/c$, is the shortest
timescale set by radiation heating or reflection. This is of the order hours, days, and years for disc, BLR,
and torus respectively. The `dynamical timescale', $t_{\rm dyn} =
R^{3}/GM$, is the shortest timescale on which we are likely to see
significant physical changes in a region, and is of the order of days, years, and
thousands of years for disc, BLR, and torus respectively. (The
`free-fall' timescale is roughly the same and orbital timescale is
$2\pi$ times longer.) More realistically, perturbations may transmit
across a region on the sound crossing timescale $t_{\rm snd} =
R/v_{\rm snd}$. This is somewhat model dependent but is of the order
of years for the accretion disc. This is the global time to cross the
whole region; local hot spots could grow on the timescale it takes
sound to cross the vertical height of the disc, which can be 1–3
orders of magnitude faster. The ``thermal'' timescale $t_{\rm therm}$
which is roughly the time it takes for for energy to dissipate within
the disc, i.e. the response timescale to a spike of energy
input. It is of the order of days for the inner disc and years for the
optical disc. The analogous ``response'' timescale for the BLR and for
the obscuring region is actually the light-crossing time - the local
response time to a change in photo-ionisation or heating is very
short, but is smeared out by the range of light travel delays.

Although the observed variability of quasars has been known since shortly after their 
discovery, only recently, with the advent of extensive imaging surveys and the 
associated, repeat spectroscopy, has given actual evidence for these 
key physical mechanisms. 

In this article we present the $z=0.378$ quasar SDSS J110057.70-005304.5 
that we have observed transitioning from a blue continuum sloped object to 
become a regular galaxy. However, along with the changes in the BELs, we 
see a major change to the disk interior to 150$R_{g}$.

\section{Results}  
%% \subsection(Results subheadings, if needed}
Figure~\ref{fig:J110057_LC_CRTS} gives the optical light curve of
J110057.  Figure~\ref{fig:J110057_spectra} shows the three optical
spectra of J110057.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur

Checking the data archives we found 
there 
VLA FIRST (i.e., 21 cm radio):
- no source within 30 arcsec
- Catalog detection limit (including CLEAN bias) at source position is 1.11 mJy/beam

Spitzer:
- hasn't observed that patch of sky.

ROSAT: 
- using the 2nd all-sky survey (2RXS - Boller et al. 2016, A&A, 588, 103)
- 2RXS J110058.1-005259
- cts = 27.00 
- cerr = 6.14
- rate = 0.06 pm 0.01
- exposure = 431.95
- NED calls it (1.27 pm 0.28)e-12 erg/cm2/s in 0.1-2.4 keV range (unabsorbed flux)

Neither {\it Chandra} or {\it XMM-Newton}.

\section{Discussion}   %% (without subheadings)
Using Ford et al and Sirko \& Goodman 2003, 
Figure~\ref{fig:model} shows a model for a $M_{\rm BH}=3\times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$, 
radiative efficiency of $\epsilon=0.1$, accretion rate in units of Eddington accretion, 
$\dot{M}=0.032$, inner and outer disk radii in units of $r_g$ of SMBH of 
radius$_{\rm in}$=6.0, radius$_{\rm out}$=1.0$\times 10^{4}$.
